## 🧑‍💻 Overview

  

This is my **first Java web application**, developed using the **Spring Boot framework** as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course at college. The project demonstrates the application of object-oriented principles in a real-world web-based context.

  

## 📝 Project Description

  

The application functions as a simple **guestbook system** for events, where guests can submit their information to register attendance. Admins can view a list of all attendees through a secure dashboard.

  

## 🔧 Tech Stack

  

-  **Framework:** Spring Boot (Java)

-  **Database:** MySQL

-  **Templating Engine:** Thymeleaf (if applicable)

-  **ORM:** Spring Data JPA

-  **Architecture:** MVC

  

## 💡 Features

  

- 🎫 **Guest Entry Form**: Visitors can enter their **name**, **agency**, **email**, and a brief **description**.

- 📋 **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can view and manage all guest entries.

- 🧱 **Database Integration**: All data is stored in a MySQL database using Spring JPA.

- 💻 **MVC Pattern**: The project follows the Model-View-Controller architecture for clean and maintainable code.

  

## 🎯 Purpose

  

The purpose of this project was to:

- Practice building web applications using **Spring Boot**

- Apply **object-oriented principles** in a full-stack Java environment

- Understand database integration and **form handling**

- Gain foundational skills in **Java web development**

  

## 🏁 How It Works

  

1. Guests access the form page and fill in their details.

2. The submitted data is validated and stored in the database.

3. Admin can log in to a dashboard to view all registered attendees.
